# Moomoo P&L Dashboard

Moomoo P&L Dashboard is a simple website to view your overall Profit and Loss for securities.

This was created because there is no way to track your total Profit and Loss for securities which you have no position in (i.e. you have completely sold all shares of that stock.)

The total P&L shown on your Moomoo's accounts page also changes wildly when you add or remove funds from your account, and is not really reflective of your true P&L.

## Installation

You can run this as a standalone app or in a docker container.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
moomoo_OpenD_8.6.4608_Ubuntu16.04/moomoo_OpenD_8.6.4608_Ubuntu16.04/OpenD
```
