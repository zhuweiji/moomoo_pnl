# Moomoo P&L Dashboard

Moomoo P&L Dashboard is a simple website to view your overall Profit and Loss for securities.

This was created because there is no way to track your total Profit and Loss for securities which you have no position in (i.e. you have completely sold all shares of that stock.)

The total P&L shown on your Moomoo's accounts page also changes wildly when you add or remove funds from your account, and is not really reflective of your true P&L.

## Features

### Page showing overall profit/loss per stock ticker

### Sell page with custom sell order types

### Buy page with custom buy order types

### Notifications for custom alerts


## Installation

This project uses `uv` to manage python dependencies.

```bash
uv run python -m src.main
```
